# Figures 

**Simple Android app built in Java using Android Studio**

App allows users to create a list of figures - circles, triangles and squares. Each figure is presented with its icon, adequate attribute (diameter, height, diagonal) and a calculated area. 

The list is generated using parameters given by the user: minimal and maximal dimensions of side/radius of figures and the number of figures to generate. The list can be sorted by figure types, areas or attributes. 

Each element on the list can be duplicated, edited or deleted; new randomly generated elements can also be added do the list.
User can delete the whole list and generate a new one. 

In stats user can check the number of figures of each type, their total area and summed value of their attributes.
